This is our groups git repository for the IBM's community hackathon 2014.

During this hackathon we'll try and build a prototype application on IBM's BlueMix for the local charity "The sky is the limit". The focus of this event is to reach a working prototype for the charity, while levearaging IBM's BlueMix technology and services.
